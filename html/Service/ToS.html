<h1><b>Terms of Service:</b></h1>
<div class="blog">
        <p>If you have a problem with any of these terms, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying for your commissioned piece.</p>
<ol>       
<li class="date1">GENERAL TERMS</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">All drawings may or will include a subtle sign that you may not remove.</li>
<li class="list">I might record the drawing process and post it on my youtube.</li>
<li class="list">Prices are subject to change based on demand.</li>
<li class="list">I have the right to reject any order that I do not feel comfortable drawing for any reason.</li>
</ul>

<li class="date1">PAYMENT</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">Currency accepted is USD and can be paid through PayPal.</li> 
<li class="list">Commissions can be paid either 100% upfront.</li>
<li class="list">Don't send me any payment before I have agreed to give you a slot and requested you to send me the payment.</li>
</ul>

<li class="date1">PROCESS AND DELIVERY</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">I will notify you when I have started on your commission and you, therefore, lose the rights to a refund (see point 7 further below for more info on refunds).</li>
<li class="list">While I'm working on your commission I will make reviews with you to make sure I make it just right for you!</li>
<li class="list">The amount of reviews depends on the complexity of the work.</li>
<li class="list">During the reviews, you will see work-in-progress and these images will usually include a watermark and be smaller than the finished piece.</li>
<li class="list">The time it takes to finish your commission varies 1 week - 1 month depending on factors such as health, the complexity of the commissioned piece, other work and con seasons.</li>
<li class="list">If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.</li>
<li class="list">Once the piece is finished you will receive the full-resolution image along with a web-friendly size. Note that there is no physical product.</li>
</ul>


<li class="date1">REVISIONS</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">You get 3 rounds of changes on the commissioned piece included in the price.</li>
<li class="list">A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless a misunderstanding from my side has been made.</li>
<li class="list">If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make(may very from 1-5$).</li>
<li class="list">If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</li>
</ul>

<li class="date1">COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</li>

<p>I, <b>Yla 3nity</b> (the artist), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to: 
Promote myself with it everywhere<br>
Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)<br>
Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)<br>
Post it wherever I want<br>
<br>
<b>The buyer is allowed to:</b><br>
Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)<br>
Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.<br> 
Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.<br>
Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.<br>
<br>
<b>The following is considered copyright infringement:</b><br>
Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.<br>
Claiming the artwork as your own<br>
Removing my signature from the artwork<br>
Altering the artwork without my consent<br>
<br>
I reserve the full rights to the image and it's use/distribution unless otherwise agreed upon (rights to the image for your own non-personal use may be purchased at any time).
</p>
 

<li  class="date1">CUSTOMER SATISFACTION</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">I will do everything I can to make my customers happy!</li>
<li class="list">If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</li>
<li class="list">I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</li>
</ul>
 

<li class="date1">REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</li>
<li class="list">If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.</li>
<li class="list">If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.</li>
<li class="list">If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.</li>
<li class="list">If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.</li>
</ul> 

<p>
If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Nadia Axel (the artist), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit. If you have a problem with any of these statements, they may be changed if discussed with me prior to paying your commissioned piece.
