<li class="list">If anything comes up that will slow the progress of the initially estimated delivery time I will let you know asap.</li>

<li class="list">A fee will be added if you want something changed on the final drawing - unless a misunderstanding from my side has been made.</li>
<li class="list">If you wish for me to change something in the drawing you have previously approved, I will charge you a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change you want me to make(may very from 1-5$).</li>
<li class="list">If your reference is unclear to start with changes will come at an extra charge.</li>
</ul>

<li class="date1">COPYRIGHT / USAGE POLICY</li>

<p>I, <b>Yla 3nity</b> (the artist), claim the rights to the produced drawing, not the buyer. Therefore I am allowed to use the copyrighted artwork to: 
Promote myself with it everywhere<br>
Publish books with it (artbooks, etc.)<br>
Display it everywhere to my liking (website, social media, etc.)<br>
Post it wherever I want<br>
<br>
<b>The buyer is allowed to:</b><br>
Use the commissioned piece for personal use unless agreed otherwise (you can upload it on all your social media profiles, forums, etc.)<br>
Print the artwork and claim the character(s) as their own, but not the artwork itself.<br> 
Use the artwork to promote themselves. You are not forced to give me credit when you post it but it is very appreciated.<br>
Use the artwork on their Youtube channel and in monetized videos as long as the artwork itself is not the main subject for the earnings.<br>
<br>
<b>The following is considered copyright infringement:</b><br>
Reproducing/using the copyrighted artwork commercially - means making money off it in any way.<br>
Claiming the artwork as your own<br>
Removing my signature from the artwork<br>
Altering the artwork without my consent<br>

<li class="list">If you have a problem with anything in regards to the commissioned piece please tell me right away so we can find a solution together.</li>
<li class="list">I am willing to change some of my terms for you if you ask before I start on your commission. If you, e.g., do not want me to post your art anywhere, we can discuss this.</li>
</ul>
 

<li class="date1">REFUND / CANCELLATION POLICY</li>
<ul>
<li class="list">The buyer is not allowed a refund once I started working on the commission.</li>
<li class="list">If for any reason I am unable to start your commission you will receive a full refund.</li>
<li class="list">If you cancel your order before I started it, you can get a full refund.</li>
<li class="list">If you are getting a refund, do not request a Paypal chargeback. I will transfer the money back to you myself.</li>
<li class="list">If you request a Paypal chargeback at any point when you were not allowed to ask for a refund you will lose all beforementioned rights to the commissioned piece and I will have the full right to profit further from it in any way. I will decline the chargeback and supply Paypal with our conversations in which we talk about the commission as evidence that I have completed work for you. Furthermore, you will be blacklisted for commissioning me again.</li>
</ul> 

<p>
If the buyer breaks any of the points stated above they will lose all the beforementioned rights to the artwork commissioned by me, Nadia Axel (the artist), and I will have the right to profit further from the commissioned artwork in any way I see fit.
