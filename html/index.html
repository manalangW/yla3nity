    <div class="date1" id="smp">Target Audience:</div>
<p>- before you start an art commission service you must know who you are selling those services to, who do you think would enjoy your art, what group or community do you think would appreciate your services.</p> 
<p>To find out who your target audience is you must first figure out what art you enjoy most, is it fantasy, sci-fi, horror, cartoons, etc.</p>
<p>After finding out your style type, find communities where people who enjoy that art style gather, what platforms they use, and where the most traffic is, where alot of eyes will see your art.</p>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->            
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Social Media Platforms:</div>
<p>An art commissioner should know the platforms you will use, such as facebook, twitter, instagram, tumblr, reddit etc.
    How to navigate the platforms, the tags, what is trending and where your art commissions will thrive. </p> 
<p id="pr"> I recommend researching the main social media platforms, and deciding which main platform you will use by familiarity and its communities, you might find your platform fast or it might take some time, just stay on course and continue through trial and error.</p>
<p>Rarely anyone can make it if they quit early, so don't quit or surrender and keep on the grind.</p>
<center><a href="../html/home.html"><img class="plat" src="../image/platforms.png"></a></center>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Price Range:</div>
<p>- an art commissioner needs to know their worth, before you start selling you must know your price range, inorder to do so you must find out the minimum wage in your location(country), after doing so you should have a reference as to what your arts price should be, wether its paid by the hour or you are paid for an exact amount.</p> 
<p id="pa">Once you have your estimated price range, you should look for other art commissioners whom you see as close to your current skill level, and adjust that price range to theirs, this step is only for those whom are beginners, once you've gained a decent number of client work and finished commissions you may increase the price range to how you feel it should be, and if that backfires you should learn from that and readjust again.</p>
<p>most art communities that invite commissions have a price minimum for their platform, so you should keep that in mind when joining art commission communities, and adjust your price range if you wish to join. </p>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Professional accounts:</div>
<p>- in order to access those platforms creating accounts are necessary, but an image is needed, you need a username that is easy to remember, if you become succesful in your art commissioning journey you should keep in mind what your @username is.</p> 
<p id="dd">think of it as a franchise or catchy store name you will use for your main accounts, and once you have your main account, use that for the other platform accounts you will make.</p>
<p>consistency is key so that if clients want to follow you on other platforms they wouldnt have to go far away from your main accounts username.</p>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">DOs and DONTs:</div>
<p>This is a list of the genres or themes that will draw and wont draw, this gives a general gist to your possible clients what you prefer to draw, and will see if you are the art commission is a for them.</p> 
<p>DOs - are themes or genres, situations younare willing to draw <br></p>
    <ul>
        <li>OCs(original characters)</li>
        <li>Fan Art</li>
        <li>Cute Pets</li>
        <li>Couples</li>
    </ul>
    <p>DONTs - are things you will absolutely not draw</p>
    <ul>
        <li>NSFW</li>
        <li>Mecha</li>
        <li id="tc">Realism</li>
        <li>Gore</li>
    </ul>
<p>There are tons of examples online and in other peoples posts, research what they are, gather your references and make your own list of DOs and DONTs</p>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Terms and Conditions:</div>
<p>This is a set of rules or conditions your clients must abide by if you they wish to purchase your commissions, these are so that you the artist and your works are protected and safe.</p> 
<p>Within this part of the art commission you will write down the following: <br>
    Dates or estimated progress in time, payment process & extra payments, and conditions for you the artists convenience, Revisions, Copyrights, .</p>
<ul>
    <li>Dates</li>
    <p> - how long it will likely take to finish a commission.</p>
    <li>Payment process</li>
    <p> - what your payment process is, whether its 50/50, fully paid, payment per hour of work.</p>
    <li>General Conditions</li>
    <p> - the right to reject any order that the artist would not feel comfortable drawing. </p>
    <li>Revisions</li>
    <p> - how many Revisions the artist will make, and when revisions can and cannot be made.</p>
    <li>Copyrights</li>
    <p> - the artist claims rights to the finished artwork, not the buyer.</p>
    <li>Usage Policy</li>
    <p> - the buyer may use the finished commission artwork for personal use, print the it and claim the character as their own, use it to promote themselves.</p>
    <li>Refund Policy</li>
    <p>- what are your refund policies, when is it alright to cancel or refund an artwork, or if the artist has a NO REFUNDS policy.</p>
</ul>
<p>An Example of my T&C:</p>
<p class="paragraph"><em>for mobile viewers: when viewing popup images please do so in landscape.</em></p>
<div class="imgc">

</div>
<br id="cs"><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1" >Commission Sheet:</div>
<p>This is a very fun step, you get to create your commission sheet, where potential clients will see information about your commissions, such as your price range, the process of your artwork, your dos and donts, and terms and conditions. </p> 
<p>Here are some examples of my own:</p>
<div class="imgc">
<div><img class="np1" src="../image/1.png" atl="commission board 1"></div>
<div><img class="np1" src="../image/2.png" atl="commission board 2"></div>
<div><img class="np1" src="../image/6.png" atl="commission board 3"></div>   
<div><img class="np1" src="../image/7.png" atl="commission board 4"></div>
</div>



<br id="ap"><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Art Portfolio:</div>
<p>A collection of other artworks you have done to show your clients what they could possibly buy from you, a showcase of your artstyle and skills, can be identified in this segment.<br>
    You can use social media for this: instagram, twitter, tumblr, facebook.</p> 
<p>Samples of my Artwork within my Art Portfolio:</p>

<h3>Steps to Selling art commissions:</h3><hr>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1" id="wai">Advertise</div>
<p>Post your commission sheet in the communities where you think people would buy your artwork.</p> 
<p>another way to go about it is to spread your advertisement in every community(related to art commissions), this strategy of advertisement is more chaotic and bold.<br> do whatever you think is the best advertising strategy for you.</p>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1" id="dis">Wait</div>
<p>time usage:(free time,study art while waiting).<br> after finishing your posts of commission advertisement a smart way to do while waiting is to improve your skills and artworks but relaxing and chilling is also an option.</p> 
<p>Getting a client will take some time, or you might get one immediately, it varies from person to person.</p>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Discuss with client</div>
<p>Once you have a client, inquire if they have fully read your commission sheet, its payment processes, terms and conditions.</p> 
<p>if they agree to your terms, you may proceed to two possible paths.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Contract Agreement</li><br>
    <p > - for those who wish to pursue becoming a professional art commissioner.<br><br id="pay">this way is the process in which the artist sends a contract that the buyer will have to sign and agree to, sending the filled up contract agreement via email.<br><br>If they have agreed tp sign your contract then ask for their gmail, and send them a copy of your terms and conditions. If they agree with your terms then they will have to send an email template of them agreeing with your Terms and conditions, this way your terms and rights to the artworks are protected.</p>
    <li>No Contract </li>
    <p> - for those who wish to sell their artwork as a hobby, only for those who desire to earn money only.<br>however their artwork will be at risk due to the lack of a contract.</p>
</ol>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1">Payment</div>
<p>Before proceeding wait for the client to pay you, do not agree to offering things such as sketches, for your time and skills arent free, even sketches have worth.</p> 
<p>I trully recommend that you go with the FULLY PAID or UPFRONT payment process, this is so that you are safe from getting scammed into making sketches or artworks that arent going to be paid in full.<br>This payment method is the safest for artists.</p>
<p>Inorder to get paid, one must possess a digital money exchange app such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Paypal</li>
    <li>CashApp</li>
    <li>Venmo</li>
    <li>Gcash</li>
    <li>any other online payment networks.</li>
</ul>
<br><hr>
</div>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1" id="pro">(/◕ヮ◕)/ Proceed with the "Process"</div>
<p>Now it is clear to start your drawing process, start with the sketches then line art, then coloring.</p> 
<p>Each time you finish one part of those(sketch,lineart,coloring), check with the client to see whether they agree with it or not.<br>Repeat this process until the client is satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<div class="date" id="pro">Revisions</div>
<p>Revisions are done during the process, if the client for example wants to back track and change the color that was already implemented, or change a particular pose, an Item or prop change.<br><br>This is where Revisions are done, If they request for more revisions but have gone beyond your Revision limit, then charge the client for payment if they want to have more revisions.<br><br>once the client has agreed to the finished outcome of the commission then you may inform them that no more commissions will be done.<br>or state that rule within your terms and conditions.</p>
<br><hr>
            </div>    
            
<div class="blog">
    <div class="date1" id="fin">Finish a Commission</div>
<p>Once the commission is finished thank your client for buying your artwork, and give your farewells.<br> 
A happy client is good for business, who knows they might return to buy another commission.</p>
